# Divergent Pathways: Tracking Cryptosporidium’s Host Adaptation

## The Origin: Strain M4

Our journey begins with a single infected mouse (M4), harboring a
Cryptosporidium strain that would become the progenitor of two distinct
evolutionary paths. This initial host served as the critical branching
point for our experimental design.

From this single origin, the parasite’s story split into two parallel
narratives:

### 🐭 The Murine Passage 🐭

> In this pathway, Cryptosporidium continued its journey through a
> series of mouse hosts, adapting to the murine environment through
> sequential passages:

    M4 → M5 → M6 → M7

Each passage potentially allowed the parasite to optimize its survival
and reproductive strategies within these genetically similar mammalian
hosts.

### 🐄 The Bovine Passage 🐄

> Simultaneously, we challenged the adaptability of the same initial
> strain by introducing it to an entirely different mammalian lineage -
> neonatal calves:

    M4 → C1 → C2 → C3

This cross-species transmission forced the parasite to navigate a
dramatically different physiological environment, potentially driving
rapid adaptation.

## 🧬 Specialized Variant Calling Strategy 🧬

The progenitor Cryptosporidium population in mouse M4 wasn’t a
homogeneous colony, but rather a **diverse mixture of strains**.

> This discovery fundamentally shaped our analytical approach.

To capture the true genetic complexity within our samples, we
implemented a customized variant calling pipeline:

    ┌────────────────────────────────┐
    │ FREEBAYES VARIANT CALLING      │
    ├────────────────────────────────┤
    │ • Ploidy = 1                   │
    │ • --pooled-continuous option   │
    └────────────────────────────────┘

Why This Approach Matters?

1.  **Beyond Binary Detection**: \> Traditional presence/absence variant
    calling would have flattened the rich complexity of our samples,
    obscuring the very phenomenon we aimed to study.

2.  **Quantitative Insight**: \> By focusing on allele frequencies
    rather than simple variant calls, will allow us to track subtle
    shifts in population genetics across hosts.

# Variant Analysis: Filtering Strategy

Our approach employed a strategic sequence of filtering steps, each
addressing specific aspects of data quality:

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ THREE-TIER FILTERING STRATEGY       │
    ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ 1. Quality-based Filtering          │
    │ 2. Read Depth Optimization          │
    │ 3. Variant Type Selection           │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘

    ======================================
    Starting Variant Filtering Process
    ======================================
    Total variants before filtering: 15901
    Stage 1: QUAL filtering: 14087 Variants removed and 1814 variants left
    Stage 2: FORMAT/DP filtering, DP >= 30 & DP <= 150: 355 Variants removed and 1459 variants left
    Stage 3: After keeping SNPs and indels: 203 Variants removed and 1256 variants left

### Stage 1: Quality-Based Filtering

``` bash
# Eliminate low confidence variant calls
bcftools filter -e 'QUAL < 30' "$INPUT_VCF" -o "$QUAL_FILTERED_VCF"
```

**Rationale**: The QUAL score represents the statistical confidence in
each variant call. By establishing a minimum threshold of 30: - We
eliminated variants likely to be sequencing errors - Retained variants
with a 99.9% probability of being genuine

### Stage 2: Read Depth Optimization

``` bash
# Balance between coverage requirements and anomalous amplification
bcftools view -i 'FMT/DP >= 30 & FMT/DP <= 150' "$QUAL_FILTERED_VCF" -o "$DP_FILTERED_VCF"
```

**Rationale**: Read depth optimization addressed two critical
concerns: - **Lower bound (DP ≥ 30)**: Ensured sufficient read
coverage - **Upper bound (DP ≤ 150)**: Protected against false positives
from regions with anomalous read pileups which often indicate repetitive
elements

### Stage 3: Variant Type Selection

``` bash
# Focus on  variation subset
bcftools view -v snps,indels "$DP_FILTERED_VCF" -o "$SNP_FILTERED_VCF"
```

**Rationale**: This final step ensured our analysis focused exclusively
on:

- Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
- Small insertions and deletions (indels)
